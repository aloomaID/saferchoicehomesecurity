            <h3>Temescal Valley, CA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Temescal Valley takes its name from the Rancho Temescal established by Leandro Serrano. Serrano received the written permission of the priest of the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, or of the military commander of San Diego, to occupy the five square league Rancho Temescal on land belonging to Mission of San Luis Rey. He took possession in about 1818 or 1819 under a grant given by Governor José María de Echeandía to Leandro Serrano. The Serrano Boulder (California Historical Landmark (#185), marks the site of the first house erected by Leandro Serrano about May 1824. The grant extended along the Temescal Valley south of present day Corona and encompassed El Cerrito and Lee Lake. The Serrano family held the land until they lost the court case validating their title to the land in 1866. Meanwhile squatters settled on the land in anticipation of this result in 1855.</p>
